# New CS 230 Project Module 8

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The Gaming Room. The Gaming Room wants to develop a web-based game that serves multiple platforms based on their current game, Draw It or Lose It, which is currently available in an Android app only.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation? The last section, the recommendations was probably the only successful submission.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? If the first two submissions were more successful it would have assisted in developing the code. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it? Sections 1 & 2.  Error and analysis was completely off.  

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?  Client discussions, meetings and interviews would have provided guidance in the design from a user's prespective.  If you don't satisfy the user's needs, the game won't be played/enjoyed.   

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?  A lot of reading, maybe too much at times.  In the future I would vet more stringently when researching technologies needed to deliver the solution.
